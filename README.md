### About

This app leverages the [eyetracking](https://github.com/EyeTrackingCSE/eyetracking) to bind Tobii `GazeFocusEvent`s to a virtual keyboard, enabling the user to type using their eyes.

The app is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) in conjunction with [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/).
